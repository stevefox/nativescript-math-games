This is a mobile app for Android and iOS built in Native Script. It started out as a "scratch-an-itch" solution to a real problem I have been running into as a personal tutor for the past thirteen years.

To run this project, first head over to [NativeScript.org](https://www.nativescript.org) and follow Native Script installation instructions in the [Quick Setup Guide](https://docs.nativescript.org/start/quick-setup) for your platform. If you already have Native Script installed, you can run it in an Android emulator using:

```bash
tns run android --emulator
```
